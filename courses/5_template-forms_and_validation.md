**host property in a directive decorator**

- In Angular, the `host property` in a directive decorator is used to define the `host bindings`, `listeners`,
  and `attributes` for the directive. It allows you to specify how a directive should interact with the host element on
  which it is applied. The host property is an object where keys are the host bindings, listeners, or attributes, and
  values are expressions or methods that define the behavior.
